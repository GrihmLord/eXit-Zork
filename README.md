eXitZork is an immersive text-based adventure game that combines the intrigue of cyberpunk narratives like Mr. Robot with the classic gameplay of Zork. Players will navigate through a rich narrative by typing commands, exploring environments, and solving puzzles, all while making decisions that shape the course of the story.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm or Yarn
- React Native environment setup (including Android Studio and/or Xcode)
